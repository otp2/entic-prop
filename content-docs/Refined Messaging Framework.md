# **Refined Messaging Framework**

## **Our Guiding Message:**

**Your best mental health is our endeavor.**

This foundational message, directly from our original materials (you can find it on Page 1 of the Original Messaging), beautifully captures our commitment to supporting complete well-being. It's simple, impactful, and resonates deeply with the broader Endeavor Health identity.

## **Core Messages (Refined for Clarity & Impact):**

Based on our original core messages and how they're emphasized in our audience materials, I propose distilling the five core messages into four. This sharpens our focus on the most vital aspects of the value we offer, creating a more cohesive structure that's easier to remember and put into practice:

### **1\. Comprehensive, connected care for your mental health journey.**

**What this means:** We provide a full continuum of mental health care, all working together seamlessly within the Endeavor Health system.

**Why it matters:** People seeking care, and the providers who refer them, need to know we can be there to support them (or their patients) at every turn in their recovery path, without the added stress of navigating fragmented systems. (This refines Original Core Messages \#2 and \#5)

### **2\. Expert, compassionate care tailored to your unique needs.**

**What this means:** Our team of highly qualified specialists delivers care grounded in evidence-based practices, always with a personal, understanding approach.

**Why it matters:** Patients and referring providers want to feel confident in the quality of care and trust that they or their patients will be treated with genuine empathy and deep expertise. (This refines Original Core Messages \#3 and \#4)

### **3\. Easy access to the right support, right when you need it.**

**What this means:** We make the process of getting started simple, helping you connect with the appropriate level of care and specialists across our extensive network of convenient locations.

**Why it matters:** Finding behavioral healthcare can feel overwhelming. We focus on removing those hurdles and ensuring timely access to care. (This refines Original Core Message \#1, incorporating elements of Original Core Message \#5)

### **4\. We're here for Illinois: trusted behavioral health expertise woven into our communities.**

**What this means:** As the largest integrated behavioral health network in Illinois, we have a significant reach and a genuine commitment to serving the diverse needs of communities across the state.

**Why it matters:** This highlights our scale, accessibility, and dedication to the people of Illinois, building trust and affirming our role as a leading provider. (This is a recurring theme and supported by statistics across the original messaging and presentations, powerfully reinforcing the merger and expanded network.)

## **Actionable Steps for Rollout:**

### **Internal Rollout / Jessi Presentation:**

* Present the four refined core messages as the clear, foundational pillars of how we communicate our behavioral health services.  
* For each core message, share the "What this means" and "Why it matters" points to provide essential context and rationale, helping everyone understand the thinking behind the messaging.  
* Use the "Internal Staff Language" examples to vividly illustrate how each core message is directly relevant to different roles and departments, emphasizing the tangible benefits to them.  
* Acknowledge openly that this framework is a thoughtful refinement of the excellent original work, building upon the strong foundation already established (perhaps mentioning it "builds on the valuable insights from the Entic Edge messaging study").  
* Focus on the enhanced simplicity and clarity of this new framework compared to the previous, more extensive version, highlighting how it's designed to be more practical and memorable.

### **Integrating into Our Conversations:**

* Gently encourage staff, particularly those in patient-facing roles (like ARC staff and therapists), to begin incorporating the audience-specific language examples into their daily interactions. These phrases have been designed to feel natural and be easy to remember in conversation.  
* Provide simple, handy cheat sheets featuring the four core messages and the top 2-3 supporting points/language examples specifically tailored for their particular audience.

### **Updating Our Materials (A Future Step):**

* Once the core messages are firmly adopted internally, we'll use them as the guiding principle for updating our PowerPoint decks, website content, and all other communication materials.  
* We will ensure that the tone and language throughout all updated materials consistently align with the Endeavor Health brand guidelines – this includes thoughtfully using "you" when addressing patients, and maintaining a tone that is confidently optimistic, genuinely empathetic, and deeply caring. (Reference: Original Messaging \- Page 13, 14, 15, and various other pages, emphasizing tone on Page 14, 15).
